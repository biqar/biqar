Hi, my name is Abdullah Al Raqibul Islam. I usually go as Raqib in real life and biqar/biqarboy in cyberspace. I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Computer Science department at UNC Charlotte (UNCC)](https://cci.charlotte.edu). I work as a research assistant in the [Data Intelligence Research (DIR)](https://github.com/DIR-LAB) lab under the supervision of [Prof. Dong Dai](https://webpages.charlotte.edu/ddai/). My research aims to build a high-performance graph storage system and optimize it for emerging storage technologies (e.g., Persistent Memory). I am particularly interested in developing data structures to efficiently store dynamic graphs without scarifying the efficiency of running graph analysis.

Before my time at UNC Charlotte, I was appointed as a Principal Software Engineer at [TigerIT Bangladesh Ltd.](https://www.tigerit.com), leading the machine learning engineering team. Besides, I was responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining server-side programming modules using different technologies, including but not limited to Spring, EJB, Apache Spark, Oracle, Elasticsearch, etc.

I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from the [University of Dhaka, Bangladesh (DU)](https://www.cse.du.ac.bd). While at DU, I participated in several competitive programming competitions, including the ICPC Asia Dhaka Regional Contest.
